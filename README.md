# Drawing Timer

Drawing Timer is a timed image viewer to assist artists with continuing their figure drawing practice without access to live figure drawing sessions. Project was created after Covid-19 social distancing closed many schools and venues that provided artists with weekly figure drawing.

## How It Works

- Users select a directory path in the settings menu, to choose a folder that contains images they would like to study.
- Choose a desired length each image is displayed for
- Choose whether to set a limit of how many images to display

### UI Features

- Timer countdown clock with image number if limit set
- Zoom slider
- Image scrolling

### Additional Settings

- Toggle image shuffle
- Toggle directory loop if all images in directory have been display and session has not ended
- Toggle sounds. A 5 second warning sounds before the end of each displayed image finishes its duration
